# Brithday-app

Simple web app that will ask the user for a name and birthday.

When the user submits the form, and depending on the current date, the app will either:

* wish the user happy birthday
* tell them how long they'll have to wait until their next birthday

### Development goals

* I use a methodical approach to solving problems
* I test-drive my code
* I create effective documentation
* I can design and build user interfaces
* I can deploy web applications
* I can design a system
